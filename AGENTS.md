# OUF project instructions

## Default resilience requirement

The project owner's decision of 2026-10-11 requires bounded resilient pause/resume by default throughout OUF. Follow [OUF resilience policy v1](https://github.com/GioNob/ouf-deploy/blob/main/docs/OUF_RESILIENCE_POLICY.md) and the module PET.

For explicitly transient failures, persist progress and retry state, pause dependent work, and retry with incremental backoff and jitter. Defaults: 5/15/60/300/900 seconds, up to20% jitter, maximum128 attempts and24hours per operation/incident, including attempt duration. Respect Retry-After; operation-specific finite profiles must be versioned and justified. Never hold shared locks/DB transactions during waits or reset budgets/checkpoints on restart.

Retries require read-only/idempotent operations or owner-proven deduplication using the same idempotency key. Ambiguous mutation outcomes require reconciliation. Permanent errors, explicit revocation, integrity/identity/configuration drift and unknown errors block automatic retry.

Keep the process observable while paused; separate liveness from readiness. Revoke/expire unproven traffic leases, and restore only with fresh evidence and valid authority/current generations. Never replay consumed activation claims, extend zero TTL, or bypass IAM/HUMAN/THS. Exhausted retry budgets remain paused for intervention, with deduplicated durable issues and no secret-bearing logs.

Verify hours-long outage/recovery, cancellation/revocation while paused, finite budgets and restart/reconciliation behavior. Record implementation limits and evidence in GitHub; documenting the rule is not proof that existing runtimes comply.
